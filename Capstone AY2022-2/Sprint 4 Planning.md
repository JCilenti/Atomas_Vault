******* Questions to ask *******

- How do we connect the DDS-M kit to the switch to capture network traffic?
- How to make sure all pieces of the kit are working together and communicating?
- Each switch is an individual computer --> run a vm (headless) on each
- Gotta start sending to dashboard
- Parse data that we need
- Run the netsniff-ng program when we need it to capture traffic
