# How can I design a simple blood test machine that runs via the raspberry pi? 

- What type of tests would I run? 
	- Renal Panel Test --> A renal panel is a group of tests that may be **performed together to evaluate kidney (renal) function**. The tests measure the amounts of various substances, including several minerals, electrolytes, proteins, and glucose (sugar), in the blood to determine the current status of the kidneys.

- How to test individual components?
	- The BMP, CMP, and most renal panels include measurements of **glucose, electrolytes, calcium, and the waste products creatinine and urea nitrogen**
		- [[Electrolyte panel]] https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/electrolyte-panel/
		- [[Comprehensive Metabolic Panel]]
- What will I need (hardware) to conduct the test? 
	- Some casing to allow blood to pool + needle to prick finger
	- Preferably a metal casing
	- Some sort of screen to show the results of the test
