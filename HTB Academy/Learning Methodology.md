A few things I can record before learning something new:
- current emotional state (calm, nervous, worried, happy, depressed, relaxed, etc.)
- the previous flow of the day so far (also with one word)
- place of work
- working hours
- duration
- sleep
- inserted breaks
- duration of the breaks
- and anything else we can think of

Questioning:
- A `rough question` would be, for example, "How can I hack X?"
- A `precise question` would be: "How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user accounts?"

Every question is based on three aspects with which we build our questions every day:
1. origin
2. process
3. result/goal
