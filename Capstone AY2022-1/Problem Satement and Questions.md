***** The Problem *****
How can we monitor the traffic on a network to know when an attack is occuring or when a possibly malicious actor (PMA) is accessing our network? 

***** Questions *****
 - How can we combine open source tools to monitor network traffic that best suits the user?
 - What are the types of users we can expect to view our dashboard? Should there be access for regular use individuals and what does this access look like? 
 - What does the network look like and where should we place nodes to monitor the traffic that is coming over the network?
 - How much traffic can we expect to receive and how will we monitor the traffic?
 - How do we handle PMA addresses?
 - How do we locate PMA addresses or actions?
 - How should the network protect itself when a PMA has breached the network?
 - How should we log a breach and prevent a similar PMA from accessign again?
 - How will we notify our network manager of the breach or PMA?
 - What will the dashboard look like for the user? Network manager?
 
 
 ***** Points of Focus *****
- Dashboard (GUI of some sort)
- Location of Network Monitoring Device (NMD)
- Detection of PMA
- PMA/Address Handling
- Redundancy of Data
- Syslog Server???
